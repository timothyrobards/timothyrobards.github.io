    <p class="leftabouttext">If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. Let your imagination be your guide.</p>

    <p class="righttext">Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. Now it's beginning to make a little sense.</p>
